        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>While building our website, I encountered some bugs that were tricky to fix. For example, it was difficult to figure out how to get the video to play properly. Choosing the right color palette for the website also took a lot of time. While designing the app, I struggled to decide on a clear theme and make sure it looked nice and matched the style we wanted.</p>

    <section id="solutions">
        <h2>Overcoming the Issues</h2>
        <p>I overcame these challenges by collaborating with my team members. Through our discussions, I discovered that Hailey was great at choosing the color palette for both the app and the website, while Angel excelled at designing the app. This teamwork alleviated much of the pressure, allowing me to focus on adding the information and small details to both the website and the app.</p>
